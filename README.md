# SU2 Python Wrapper Adapter

preCICE functionality implemented in Python with only minor updates made to the python wrapper in SU2 for it to work.

Universal location of updated python wrapper and all test cases to verify functionality.


TODO: update installation instructions. Must still wipe meson to ensure that python wrapper functions are actually implemented. May be a better way to do this though.

Must be using dual-time. Adapter only designed to work with compressible solver EULER, NAVIER_STOKES, and RANS.
